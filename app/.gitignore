Shouldn't pubspec.lock also be ignored? –

It should be commited for applications: "For application packages, do commit pubspec.lock. This file is the recommended way for non-shared resources such as applications to manage their dependencies." dart.dev/guides/libraries/private-files –

For library packages, don’t commit the pubspec.lock file. Regenerating the pubspec.lock file lets you test your package against the latest compatible versions of its dependencies. See dart.dev/guides/libraries/private-files#pubspeclock for more info. –

gradlew seems to need to be checked in version control, instead of gitignored. see: stackoverflow.com/questions/43954932/… –

VSCode provides this and is equally good as the android studio version
